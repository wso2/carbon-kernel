    <!--
        The membership scheme used in this setup. The only values supported at the moment are
        "multicast" and "wka"

        1. multicast - membership is automatically discovered using multicasting
        2. wka - Well-Known Address based multicasting. Membership is discovered with the help
            of one or more nodes running at a Well-Known Address. New members joining a
            cluster will first connect to a well-known node, register with the well-known node
            and get the membership list from it. When new members join, one of the well-known
            nodes will notify the others in the group. When a member leaves the cluster or
            is deemed to have left the cluster, it will be detected by the Group Membership
            Service (GMS) using a TCP ping mechanism.
