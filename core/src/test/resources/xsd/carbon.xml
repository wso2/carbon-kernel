         Currently there can be two modes
         1. Scheduled Mode - (enable below property to "scheduled") - where the task runs periodically and trigger deployment
         2. Triggered Mode - (enable below property to "triggered") - the deployment has to be triggered externally,
            eg : in a worker node we don't need the task to run, but rather when we receive a
                 cluster msg,  the deployment has to be triggered manually
