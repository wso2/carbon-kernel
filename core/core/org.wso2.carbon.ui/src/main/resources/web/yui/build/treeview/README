TreeView - Release Notes

2.6.0
  * Keyboard Navigation
  * Delegated event listeners replace the inline listeners
  * Tree serialization/deserialization
  * Build tree from existing markup
  * Node click and dblclick events
  * DateNode (calendar control integration)
  * Editable node labels (double-click to edit the label)
  * render/destroy methods

2.5.2
  * Made CSS adjustments to work with base.css

2.5.1
  * No change

2.5.0
  * Added isLeaf property to Node that allows dynamically loaded trees to
    have nodes that are not dynamically loaded (without configuring dynamic
    load for each individual dynamic node, which was the requirement previously).  
    If set to true, dynamic loading will be disabled for the node and it 
    will always have the leaf node presentation (rather than the expand icon).
  * Made CSS adjustments to work with base.css
  * HTMLNode: removed unused property 'content', and documented the correct
    property 'html'.

2.4.0
  * added TreeView getNodeByElement, which will return a YAHOO.widget.Node 
    reference for any ancestor HTML element of a node in the tree.
  * Added 'title' property to TextNode
  * Added treeview/tooltip example
  * Passing a null or invalid animation type to setExpandAnim/setCollapseAnim
    will turn off animation for the tree.
  * Spacer style set to 12px width to fix layout inside overflow containers.
  * Fixed removeAll() when executed on the root node.
  * TextNode's href property is now escaped.
  * The 'expanded' property in a node's constructor now works for dynamically
    loaded nodes.

2.3.1

  * The "expand" event no longer fires twice for dynamically loaded nodes.

  * Added setHtml() to HTMLNode, which will synchronize the html and data
    properties, as well as the content of the node if it has been rendered.

2.3.0

  * The image preload feature was restored.

  * Added the new skin

  * Leaf nodes created with expanded=true have the child div hidden initially
    to work around an IE rendering issue.

2.2.2

  * No change

2.2.1

  * Fixed the default value in the documentation for the nowrap property in Node
    (the default value is false).

2.2.0

  * Node::insertAfter properly nulls the nextSibling attribute when the
    inserted before the firstChild.

  * MenuNodes inserted at the root level will no longer lose the menu behavior.

  * TextNode::setUpLabel sets the data.label property as well as the label property.

  * TaskNode example: made the logger optional, and moved the creation of the logger
    instance to the proper location.

  * TaskNodes added to a node that is in a fully selected state will update the
    parent to a partially selected state.

  * TaskNode example fixed to propagate the labelClick event


0.12.2

  * removeChildren will now work properly on the root node.

0.12.1

  * Added custom events for expandComplete and collapseComplete.  These events are
    needed in situations where the implementer needs to resize or reposition 
    something based on the new offset.

  * Added a "nowrap" property to Node, and set the default to false.  Specifies
    whether or not the content area of the node should be allowed to wrap
    naturally.

  * Added additional HTML elements to preserve the tree presentation when constrained
    by a parent element.

0.12.0

  * TreeView now augments EventProvider, and has custom events for expand,
    collapse, animStart, animComplete, and labelClick.  Existing implementations
    using abstract methods for these events (if they exist) will still work.
    New events can be plugged into the tree by the Node implementation.  For
    example, TaskNode adds a checkClick event.  EventProvider makes it safe
    to do this because implementing code can call subscribe() prior to the
    event creation.

  * YAHOO.util.Event is now a requirement for the widget

  * TreeView::removeChildren no longer expands and collapses the node.

  * Documented the moveComplete property

  * createElement("DIV") changed to createElement("div")

0.11.4

   * Fixed a javascript error on the HTML node example page.

0.11.3

   * popNode now clears the tree, previousSibling, nextSibling, and parent
     properties of the node that is being removed from the tree.

   * Fixed the paths to the images in the tree.css file that is included in
     build/assets.

0.11.0

   * Added TreeView -> popNode, which differs from removeNode in that the
     node's children are preserved so the entire branch can be re-inserted
     into another part of the tree, or another tree.

   * Added TreeView -> getNodesByProperty, which differs from 
     getNodeByProperty by returning an array of all nodes that have the
     specified property rather than just the first one.

   * Added Node -> insertBefore, insertAfter, and appendTo.  These method
     can be used to reorganize the tree.

   * removeChildren properly resets the node icon when executed against a 
     collpased node.
     
   * Moved depth assignment from the constructor to appendChild so that the
     value is set properly if the node is moved within the tree.

   * Fixed broken loop in removeChildren.

   * RootNode -> loadComplete calls tree.draw for hot-wiring the dynamic load
     feature for the top level nodes.

   * The treeview constructor will accept an element instead of an id.

0.10.0

   * If the child collection changes prior to a refresh(), the icon is now
     changed appropriately.

   * Added TreeView removeChildren(node).  This will recursively purge the node's
     children, and reset its dynamic load state.  

   * previousSibling and nextSibling are now adjusted correctly when a
     node is deleted.

   * expand()/collapse() now will not expand/collapse the node if false is
     returned from the onExpand/onCollapse event handlers.

   * The onExpand and onCollapse events now fire before the node is expanded
     or collapsed so that the implementer can modify the node's child collection
     prior to display.

   * The childrenRendered property previous was used to indicate both that
     a dynamically loaded node has received its data, and also to indicate
     that the children html has been created.  This has been split into
     two properties.  dynamicLoadComplete and childrenRendered.

   * Implemented the renderHidden flag.  If set to true, the html for the entire
     tree will be created when tree.draw() is called, not just the html for the
     visible nodes.

   * Added an onLabelClick listener to TextNode

   * TreeView.removeNode no longer automatically refreshes the tree.  It has an
     optional parameter to perform the refresh.

   * removeNode can now be executed on nodes that have not been rendered.

   * You can now delete top-level nodes.

   * Added onCheckClick listener to the TaskNode example

   * Added Node.iconMode, which is a property that configures the way 
     dynamically loaded nodes are displayed when they are expanded and contain 
     no children.

   * TreeView/Node.setDynamicLoad now accepts an optional second parameter to 
     set the iconMode property.

   * Fixed an issue in the TaskNode.js example that prevented setting the checked
     state of a node through the constructor.

   * Fixed an issue in HTMLNode that caused rendering issues when hasIcon was 
     set to true.

   * Added TreeView.removeNode

   * Added Node.refresh
