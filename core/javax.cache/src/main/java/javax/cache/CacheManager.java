/**
 * A {@link CacheManager} provides a means of establishing, configuring,
 * acquiring, closing and destroying uniquely named {@link Cache}s.
 * <p>
 * {@link Cache}s produced and owned by a {@link CacheManager} typically share
 * common infrastructure, for example, a common {@link ClassLoader} and
 * implementation specific {@link java.util.Properties}.
 * <p>
 * Implementations of {@link CacheManager} may additionally provide and share
 * external resources between the {@link Cache}s being managed, for example,
 * the content of the managed {@link Cache}s may be stored in the same cluster.
 * <p>
 * By default {@link CacheManager} instances are typically acquired through the
 * use of a {@link javax.cache.spi.CachingProvider}.  Implementations however may additionally
 * provide other mechanisms to create, acquire, manage and configure
 * {@link CacheManager}s, including:
 * <ul>
 * <li>making use of {@link java.util.ServiceLoader}s,</li>
 * <li>permitting the use of the <code>new</code> operator to create a
 * concrete implementation, </li>
 * <li>providing the construction through the use of one or more
 * builders, and</li>
 * <li>through the use of dependency injection.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The default {@link CacheManager} however can always be acquired using the
 * default configured {@link javax.cache.spi.CachingProvider} obtained by the {@link Caching}
 * class.  For example:
 * <pre><code>
 * CachingProvider provider = Caching.getCachingProvider();
 * CacheManager manager = provider.getCacheManager();
 * </code></pre>
 * <p>
 * Within a Java process {@link CacheManager}s and the {@link Cache}s they
 * manage are scoped and uniquely identified by a {@link java.net.URI},  the meaning of
 * which is implementation specific. To obtain the default {@link java.net.URI},
 * {@link ClassLoader} and {@link java.util.Properties} for an implementation, consult the
 * {@link javax.cache.spi.CachingProvider} class.
