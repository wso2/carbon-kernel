     Apache Axiom 1.2.11 Release Note

===========================================

  Axiom 1.2.11 is a maintenance release to support the upcoming Axis2 1.6 release.
  It also introduces a couple of new APIs that make it easier to support alternative
  Axiom implementations and that eliminate the need to refer to internal Axiom APIs.
  
  Resolved JIRA issues:
  
    * [AXIOM-12] - OMOutputFormat: doSWA and doOptimize should be mutually exclusive...plus we need doOptimizeThreshold

    * [AXIOM-274] - Refactor/deprecate MIMEOutputUtils
    * [AXIOM-275] - Implement non JavaMail implementation of MultipartWriter
    * [AXIOM-313] - Add a new getDocumentElement method to StAXOMBuilder that allows to discard the OMDocument
    * [AXIOM-333] - getFirstChildWithName should not read the next element.
    * [AXIOM-346] - Enhance OMStAXWrapper/OMNavigator to work with OMDocument objects
    * [AXIOM-351] - Links in Javadoc JARs are broken
