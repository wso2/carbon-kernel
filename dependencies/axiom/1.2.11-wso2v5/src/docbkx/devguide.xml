        <title>Testing</title>
        <section>
            <title>Unit test organization</title>
            <para>
                Historically, all unit tests were placed in the <filename>axiom-tests</filename> project.
                One specific problem with this is that since all tests are in a common Maven module
                which depends on both <filename>axiom-impl</filename> and <filename>axiom-dom</filename>,
                it is not rare to see DOOM tests that accidentally use the LLOM implementation (which is the default).
                The project description in <filename>axiom-tests/pom.xml</filename> indicates that it
                was the intention to split the <filename>axiom-tests</filename> project into several parts
                and make them part of <filename>axiom-api</filename>, <filename>axiom-impl</filename> and
                <filename>axiom-dom</filename>. This reorganization is not complete
                yet<footnote><para>See <ulink url="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WSCOMMONS-419">WSCOMMONS-419</ulink>.</para></footnote>.
                For new test cases (or when refactoring existing tests), the following guidelines should be applied:
            </para>
            <orderedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>
                        Tests that validate the code in <filename>axiom-api</filename> and that do not require
                        an Axiom implementation to execute should be placed in <filename>axiom-api</filename>.
                        This primarily applies to tests that validate utility classes in <filename>axiom-api</filename>.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        The code of unit tests that apply to all Axiom implementations and that check conformance
                        to the specifications of the Axiom API should be added
                        to <filename>axiom-api</filename> and executed in <filename>axiom-impl</filename> and
                        <filename>axiom-dom</filename>. Currently, the recommended way is to create a
                        base class in <filename>axiom-api</filename> (with suffix <classname>TestBase</classname>) and
                        to create subclasses in <filename>axiom-impl</filename> and <filename>axiom-dom</filename>.
                        This makes sure that the DOOM tests never accidentally use LLOM (because
                        <filename>axiom-impl</filename> is not a dependency of <filename>axiom-dom</filename>).

                        Java 1.5 (so that e.g. integration with JAXB2 can be tested).

                        Check the dependencies between Java packages in the <filename>axiom-api</filename> module.
                        The <package>org.apache.axiom.util</package> package (including its subpackages) is specified
                        to contain utility classes that don't depend on higher level APIs. More precisely,
                        <package>org.apache.axiom.util</package> should only have dependencies on
                        <package>org.apache.axiom.ext</package>, but not e.g. on <package>org.apache.axiom.om</package>.
                        <ulink url="http://www.hello2morrow.com/products/sonarj">SonarJ</ulink> can be used
                        to check these dependencies. The following figure shows the expected structure:

                        The check can also be done using <ulink url="http://mojo.codehaus.org/jdepend-maven-plugin/">jdepend-maven-plugin</ulink>.
                        To do this, execute the following command in the <filename>axiom-api</filename> module:

                        The report should not show any package cycles involving <package>org.apache.axiom.mime</package>,
                        <package>org.apache.axiom.util</package> and <package>org.apache.axiom.ext</package>.

                        In particular, unit test related classes should be excluded, except for the test suite
                        classes in <package>org.apache.axiom.ts</package> (we don't need to hide the fact that we have

                        (requires Python 2.6). It will copy the files and execute any necessary Subversion
                        commands to add new files and to delete files that no longer exist. After executing the
                        script, commit the changes to Subversion.

                    Apache Axiom is a StAX-based, XML Infoset compliant object model which supports on-demand building
                    of the object tree. It supports a novel "pull-through" model which allows one to turn off the tree
                    building and directly access the underlying pull event stream. It also has built in support for
                    XML Optimized Packaging (XOP) and MTOM, the combination of which allows XML to carry binary
                    data efficiently and in a transparent manner. The combination of these is an easy to use API
                    with a very high performant architecture!

                    Developed as part of Apache Axis2, Apache Axiom is the core of Apache Axis2. However, it is a
                    pure standalone XML Infoset model with novel features and can be used independently of Apache Axis2.

        <title>The StAX specification</title>
        <para>
            The StAX specification comprises two parts: a specification document titled <quote>Streaming API
            For XML JSR-173 Specification</quote> and a Javadoc describing the API. Both can be downloaded from the
            <ulink url="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=173">JSR-173 page</ulink>. Since StAX is part of Java 6,
            the Javadocs can also be viewed

            <title>Semantics of the <methodname>setPrefix</methodname> method</title>
            <para>
                Probably one of the more obscure parts of the StAX specifications is the meaning of the
                <methodname>setPrefix</methodname><footnote><para>For simplicity, we only discuss
                <methodname>setPrefix</methodname> here. The same remarks also apply to
                <methodname>setDefaultNamespace</methodname>.</para></footnote> method defined by <classname>XMLStreamWriter</classname>.
                To understand how this method works, it is necessary to look at different parts of the specification:

            <para>
                In addition, it is important to note the following facts:
            </para>
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>
                        The terms <firstterm>defaulting prefixes</firstterm> used in section 5.2.2 of the
                        specification and <firstterm>namespace repairing</firstterm> used in the Javadocs
                        of <classname>XMLStreamWriter</classname> are synonyms.
                    </para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>
                        The methods writing namespace qualified information items, i.e.
                        <methodname>writeStartElement</methodname>, <methodname>writeEmptyElement</methodname>
                        and <methodname>writeAttribute</methodname> all come in two variants: one that
                        takes a namespace URI and a prefix as arguments and one that only takes a
                        namespace URI, but no prefix.
                    </para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
            <para>
                The purpose of the <methodname>setPrefix</methodname> method is simply to define the prefixes that
                will be used by the variants of the <methodname>writeStartElement</methodname>,
                <methodname>writeEmptyElement</methodname> and <methodname>writeAttribute</methodname> methods
                that only take a namespace URI (and the local name). This becomes clear by looking at the
                table in the <classname>XMLStreamWriter</classname> Javadoc. Note that a call to
                <methodname>setPrefix</methodname> doesn't cause any output and it is still necessary
                to use <methodname>writeNamespace</methodname> to actually write the necessary
                namespace declarations. Otherwise the produced document will not be well formed with
                respect to namespaces.
            </para>
            <para>
                The Javadoc of the <methodname>setPrefix</methodname> method also clearly defines the scope
                of the prefix bindings defined using that method: a prefix bound using
                <methodname>setPrefix</methodname> remains valid till the invocation of
                <methodname>writeEndElement</methodname> corresponding to the last invocation of
                <methodname>writeStartElement</methodname>. While not explicitly mentioned in the
                specifications, it is clear that a prefix binding may be masked by another binding
                for the same prefix defined in a nested element.
            </para>
            <para>
                An aspect that may cause confusion is the fact that in the example shown in section
                5.3.2 of the specifications, the calls to <methodname>setPrefix</methodname> (and
                <methodname>setDefaultNamespace</methodname>) all appear immediately before a
                call to <methodname>writeStartElement</methodname> or <methodname>writeEmptyElement</methodname>.
                This may lead people to incorrectly believe that a prefix binding defined using
                <methodname>setPrefix</methodname> only applies to the next element
                written<footnote><para>Another factor that contributes to the confusion is that in SAX,
                prefix mappings are always generated before the corresponding <methodname>startElement</methodname>
                event and that their scope ends with the corresponding <methodname>endElement</methodname>
                event. This is so because the <classname>ContentHandler</classname> interface specifies that
                <quote>all <methodname>startPrefixMapping</methodname> events will occur immediately before the
                corresponding <methodname>startElement</methodname> event, and all <methodname>endPrefixMapping</methodname>
                events will occur immediately after the corresponding <methodname>endElement</methodname>
                event</quote>.</para></footnote>.
                This interpretation is clearly in contradiction with the <methodname>setPrefix</methodname>
                Javadoc, unless one assumes that <quote>the current START_ELEMENT / END_ELEMENT pair</quote>
                means the element opened by a call to <methodname>writeStartElement</methodname> immediately following
                the call to <methodname>setPrefix</methodname>. This however would be a very arbitrary interpretation
                of the Javadoc<footnote><para>Early versions of XL XP-J were based on this interpretation of the
                specifications, but this has been corrected. Versions conforming to the specifications support
                a special property called <varname>javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamWriter.isSetPrefixBeforeStartElement</varname>,
                which always returns <code>Boolean.FALSE</code>. This allows to easily distinguish the non
                conforming versions from the newer versions. Note that in contrast to what the usage of the reserved
                <literal>javax.xml.stream</literal> prefix suggests, this is a vendor specific property that
                is not supported by other implementations.</para></footnote>.
            </para>
            <para>
                The correctness of the comments in the previous paragraph can be checked using the following
                code snippet:
            </para>
<programlisting>XMLOutputFactory f = XMLOutputFactory.newInstance();
XMLStreamWriter writer = f.createXMLStreamWriter(System.out);
writer.writeStartElement("root");
writer.setPrefix("p", "urn:ns1");
writer.writeEmptyElement("urn:ns1", "element1");
writer.writeEmptyElement("urn:ns1", "element2");
writer.writeEndElement();
writer.flush();
writer.close();</programlisting>
            <para>
                This produces the following output<footnote><para>This has been tested with
                Woodstox 3.2.9, SJSXP 1.0.1 and version 1.2.0 of the reference
                implementation.</para></footnote>:
            </para>
<screen><![CDATA[<root><p:element1/><p:element2/></root>]]></screen>
            <para>
                Since the code doesn't call <methodname>writeNamespace</methodname>, the output is obviously not
                well formed with respect to namespaces, but it also clearly shows that the scope of the
                prefix binding for <literal>p</literal> extends to the end of the
                <sgmltag class="element">root</sgmltag> element and is not limited to
                <sgmltag class="element">element1</sgmltag>.
            </para>
            <para>
                To avoid unexpected results and keep the code maintainable, it is in general advisable to keep
                the calls to <methodname>setPrefix</methodname> and <methodname>writeNamespace</methodname> aligned,
                i.e. to make sure that the scope (in <classname>XMLStreamWriter</classname>) of the prefix binding
                defined by <methodname>setPrefix</methodname> is compatible with the scope (in the produced
                document) of the namespace declaration written by the corresponding call
                to <methodname>writeNamespace</methodname>. This makes it necessary to write code like this:
            </para>
<programlisting>writer.writeStartElement("p", "element1", "urn:ns1");
writer.setPrefix("p", "urn:ns1");
writer.writeNamespace("p", "urn:ns1");</programlisting>
            <para>
                As can be seen from this code snippet, keeping the two scopes in sync makes it necessary to use
                the <methodname>writeStartElement</methodname> variant which takes an explicit prefix. Note that
                this somewhat conflicts with the purpose of the <methodname>setPrefix</methodname> method;
                one may consider this as a flaw in the design of the StAX API.

            <title>The three <classname>XMLStreamWriter</classname> usage patterns</title>
            <para>
                Drawing the conclusions from the previous section and taking into account that
                <classname>XMLStreamWriter</classname> also has a <quote>namespace repairing</quote>
                mode, one can see that there are in fact three different ways to use
                <classname>XMLStreamWriter</classname>. These usage patterns correspond to the
                three bullets in section 5.2.2 of the StAX specification<footnote><para>The content
                of this section is largely based on a <ulink url="http://markmail.org/message/olsdl3p3gciqqeob">reply
                posted by Tatu Saloranta on the Axiom mailing list</ulink>. Tatu is the main developer of the
                Woodstox project.</para></footnote>:
            </para>
            <orderedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>
                        In the <quote>namespace repairing</quote> mode (enabled by the
                        <varname>javax.xml.stream.isRepairingNamespaces</varname> property), the writer
                        takes care of all namespace bindings and declarations, with minimal help from
                        the calling code. This will always produce output that is well-formed with respect
                        to namespaces. On the other hand, this adds some overhead and the result may
                        depend on the particular StAX implementation (though the result produced by
                        different implementations will be equivalent).
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        In repairing mode the calling code should avoid writing namespaces explicitly
                        and leave that job to the writer. There is also no need to call
                        <methodname>setPrefix</methodname>, except to suggest a preferred prefix for
                        a namespace URI. All variants of <methodname>writeStartElement</methodname>,
                        <methodname>writeEmptyElement</methodname> and <methodname>writeAttribute</methodname>
                        may be used in this mode, but the implementation can choose whatever prefix mapping
                        it wants, as long as the output results in proper URI mapping for elements and
                        attributes.

                    <para>
                        Only use the variants of the writer methods that take an explicit prefix together
                        with the namespace URI. In this usage pattern, <methodname>setPrefix</methodname>
                        is not used at all and it is the responsibility of the calling code to keep
                        track of prefix bindings.
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        Note that this approach is difficult to implement when different parts of the output document
                        will be produced by different components (or even different libraries). Indeed, when
                        passing the <classname>XMLStreamWriter</classname> from one method or component
                        to the other, it will also be necessary to pass additional information about the
                        prefix mappings in scope at that moment, unless the it is acceptable to let the
                        called method write (potentially redundant) namespace declarations for all namespaces
                        it uses.

                    <para>
                        Use <methodname>setPrefix</methodname> to keep track of prefix bindings and make sure that
                        the bindings are in sync with the namespace declarations that have been written,
                        i.e. always use <methodname>setPrefix</methodname> immediately before or immediately
                        after each call to <methodname>writeNamespace</methodname>. Note that the code is
                        still free to use all variants of <methodname>writeStartElement</methodname>,
                        <methodname>writeEmptyElement</methodname> and <methodname>writeAttribute</methodname>;
                        it only needs to make sure that the usage it makes of these methods is consistent with
                        the prefix bindings in scope.
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        The advantage of this approach is that it allows to write modular code: when a
                        method receives an <classname>XMLStreamWriter</classname> object (to write
                        part of the document), it can use
                        the namespace context of that writer (i.e. <methodname>getPrefix</methodname>
                        and <methodname>getNamespaceContext</methodname>) to determine which namespace
                        declarations are currently in scope in the output document and to avoid
                        redundant or conflicting namespace declarations. Note that in order to do so,
                        such code will have to check for an existing prefix binding before starting
                        to use a namespace.
