        <h1>Code Generator Wizard Guide for Eclipse Plug-in</h1>
        <p>This document explains the usage of this code generator plug-in
        for Eclipse. In other words, this document will guide you through
        the operations of generating a WSDL file from a Java class and/or
        generating a Java class file from a WSDL file.</p>

        <section name="Introduction">
            <p>The Axis2 code generator comes built-in with an <a href=
            "http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> plug-in. This plug-in can be
            used to generate a WSDL file from a java class (Java2WSDL) and/or a
            java class file from a WSDL (WSDL2Java). First you need to install
            the plug-in. The instructions for the installation process are
            given below.</p>
        </section>
        <section name="Installation">
            <p>
                Installation instructions for the plugin can be found
                <a href="plugin-installation.html">here</a>.
            </p>

        <section name="Operation">
            <subsection name="WSDL2Java">
                <p>If the plug-in is properly installed you should see a new wizard
                under the "New" section.(use the File -&gt; New -&gt; Other or Ctrl
                + N )</p>
                <p><img alt="wsdl2java-screen0" src="images/wsdl2java-screen0.png" /></p>
                <p>Selecting the wizard and pressing the "Next" button will start
                the code generator wizard. Following is the first wizard page.</p>
                <p><strong>Page 1:</strong></p>
                <p><img alt="wsdl2java-screen1" src="images/wsdl2java-screen1.png" /></p>
                <p>Selecting the "Generate Java source code from WSDL file" option
                and clicking "Next" leads to the following page.</p>
                <p><strong>WSDL2Java Page 2 :</strong></p>
                <p><img alt="wsdl2java-screen2" src="images/wsdl2java-screen2.png" /></p>
                <p>To move on to the next page the WSDL file location must be
                given. The "Browse" button can be used to easily browse for a file
                rather than typing the whole path.</p>
                <p><strong>WSDL2Java Page 3 :</strong></p>
                <p>Once the WSDL file is selected, the next page will take you to
                the page from where <strong>codegen options</strong> are to be
                selected. By far this is the most important page in this wizard.
                This page determines the characteristics of the code being
                generated.</p>
                <p>Novices need not worry about these options since the most common
                options are defaulted, but advanced users will find it very easy to
                turn the knobs using these options.</p>
                <p><img alt="wsdl2java-screen3" src="images/wsdl2java-screen3.png" /></p>
                <p>What advanced users can do is select custom from the select
                codegen options drop down list and then change/edit the fields that
                you need.</p>
                <p><img alt="wsdl2java-screen31" src="images/wsdl2java-screen31.png" /></p>
                <p>Once the options are selected, only the final step of the code
                generation is left which is the selection of the output file
                location.</p>
                <p><strong>WSDL2Java Page 4 :</strong></p>
                <p>Here you can select the output file path by typing or browsing
                using the "Browse" button. You have the option of browsing only
                eclipse workspace projects by selecting the "Add the source to a
                project on current eclipse workspace" radio button. Or else you
                have the option to save the codegen resutls to file system</p>
                <p><img alt="wsdl2java-screen4" src="images/wsdl2java-screen4.png" /></p>
                <p>Here also you have the option to add some value to the codegen
                results. If you have enabled the check box "Add Axis2 libraries to
                the codegen result project" then all other controls below will get
                enabled. What you can do is point the downloaded Axis2_HOME
                location via the "Browse" button. Then you can verify the
                availability of the Axis2 libs by clicking on the "Check Libs"
                button. If all goes well then you can add the axis 2 libs to the
                codegen results location. Another option is available to generate a
                jar file if the user needs to add the codegen results to a project
                as a compiled jar file to the selected locations lib directory.</p>
                <p><img alt="wsdl2java-screen41" src="images/wsdl2java-screen41.png" /></p>
                <p>When the output file location is selected, the "Finish" button
                will be enabled. Clicking the "Finish" button will generate the
                code and a message box will pop up acknowledging the success. Well
                Done! You've successfully completed Axis2 code generation.</p>

            <subsection name="Java2WSDL">
                <p><strong>Page 1:</strong></p>
                <p>For this operation you need to select the option which says
                "Generate a WSDL from a Java source file"</p>
                <p><img alt="java2wsdl-screen0" src="images/java2wsdl-screen0.png" /></p>
                <p>Then click the "Next" button which will lead to the next page
                below.</p>
                <p><strong>Java2WSDL Page 2:</strong></p>
                <p><img alt="java2wsdl-screen1" src="images/java2wsdl-screen1.png" /></p>
                <p>In this page one needs to select the class to be exposed and the
                relevant jar files /classes to be loaded as the classpath. After
                the libraries have been set, the "Test Class Loading" button must
                be clicked in order to test whether the class is loadable. Unless
                the class loading is successful proceeding to the "Next" button
                will not be enabled.</p>
                <p>Once the classloading is successful and "Next" button is clicked
                the page below will appear.</p>
                <p><strong>Java2WSDL Page 3:</strong></p>
                <p>This page allows the parameters to be modified by setting the
                options for the generator.</p>
                <p><img alt="java2wsdl-screen2" src="images/java2wsdl-screen2.png" /></p>
                <p><strong>Java2WSDL Page 4:</strong></p>
                <p>Here you can select the output file path by typing or browsing
                using the "Browse" button. You have the option of browsing only
                Eclipse workspace projects by selecting the "Add the source to a
                project on current eclipse workspace" radio button . Or else you
                have the option to save the codegen resutls to file system. Once
                the output file location and the output WSDL file name is added you
                can click the "Finish" button to complete generation.</p>
                <p><img alt="java2wsdl-screen3" src="images/java2wsdl-screen3.png" /></p>
                <p>If a message box pops up acknowledging the success, then you've
                successfully completed the Java2WSDL code generation.</p>
